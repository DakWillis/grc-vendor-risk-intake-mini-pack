# Vendor Risk Intake Mini Pack (GRC)

This repository demonstrates a lightweight, repeatable Third-Party/Vendor Risk Intake process that can be used by small to mid-sized organizations.

## What this includes
- A practical vendor intake form
- A simple risk scoring model (impact + exposure)
- Evidence request checklist
- Vendor decision log (approve / approve with conditions / reject)
- A basic vendor review email template

## Why this matters
Third-party risk is a common source of security, privacy, and compliance exposure. This mini pack shows how I structure intake, evidence collection, and decision-making in a way that is audit-friendly and scalable.

## How to use
1. Start in `docs/01-workflow.md`
2. Fill out `artifacts/vendor-intake-form.md`
3. Score the vendor using `artifacts/vendor-risk-scorecard.csv`
4. Request evidence using `artifacts/evidence-request-checklist.md`
5. Document the decision in `artifacts/vendor-decision-log.csv`

## Quickstart (15-minute vendor review)
1. Fill out the intake: `artifacts/vendor-intake-form.md`
2. Score the vendor: `artifacts/vendor-risk-scorecard.csv`
3. Select evidence based on tier: `artifacts/evidence-request-checklist.md`
4. Document the decision: `artifacts/vendor-decision-log.csv`
5. Set the next review date based on risk tier: see `docs/01-workflow.md`
