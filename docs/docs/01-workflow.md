# Workflow

## Step 1 — Intake
Collect basic vendor information, data types, access, and business purpose.

## Step 2 — Classify
Determine inherent risk based on:
- Data sensitivity
- System access level
- Business criticality

## Step 3 — Evidence request
Request evidence proportional to risk level (low/medium/high).

## Step 4 — Review + decision
Approve, approve with conditions, or reject.
Document the decision and any conditions.

## Step 5 — Reassessment cadence
- High risk: annual review
- Medium risk: every 2 years
- Low risk: every 3 years or upon material change
